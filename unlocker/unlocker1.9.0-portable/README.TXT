Using Unlocker
--------------

How often have you tried to delete or rename a file or folder and got
"Cannot delete xxx: It is being used by another person or program." ?

Unlocker is a tool which will help you overcoming this scandalous Windows
bug.

Simply right click the file or folder and select Unlocker. If the file
or folder is locked then a window will appear with a list of processes
locking the file or folder. Select the locks and click Unlock and you 
are done.

It is recommended to Unlock wisely and to close open processes locking
files or folder if any, but if only Explorer.exe is the culprit, do not
hesitate! :D
